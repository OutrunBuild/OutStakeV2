# OutStakeV2

Foundry-only workspace.

Project commands:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run gas:report`

Harness commands:

- `npm run gate:fast` - rapid local feedback: fmt, lint, build, and changed/mapped tests
- `npm run gate` - default local gate, same as `gate:fast`
- `npm run gate:full` - release-like local gate
- `npm run gate:ci` - CI gate; CI must pass explicit changed-file input

`script/harness/gate.sh --classify-only` emits policy-derived orchestration fields without running verification commands.

## How The Gate Works

1. **Classify surfaces** - every changed file is matched against `.harness/policy.json`.
2. **Classify change class** - Solidity diffs are parsed for semantic changes while ignoring comments, whitespace, and punctuation-only lines.
3. **Select orchestration** - gate emits `orchestration_profile`, `selected_writer_roles`, and `selected_review_roles`.
4. **Run verification** - normal gate profiles run commands selected by profile and changed-file scope.
5. **Emit run record** - when `RUN_RECORD_PATH` is set, the gate writes classification, orchestration, command results, and final verdict.

Change classes: `no-op` | `non-semantic` | `test-semantic` | `prod-semantic`.

Orchestration profiles:

| Profile | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `direct` | main session edits; no writer/reviewer dispatch |
| `direct-review` | main session edits; selected reviewers run |
| `delegated` | policy-selected writer handles docs/process/control changes |
| `full-review` | policy-selected writer plus full review matrix |
| `full-subagent` | full review plus independent verifier |
| `blocked` | stop before editing |
| `no-op` | no classified changes |

Production Solidity semantic changes never downgrade by static allowlist and never escalate by static keyword denylist alone. Small localized production Solidity changes may use `direct-review` only after a main-session Risk Analysis Record. If analysis is incomplete or uncertain, use at least `full-review`.

## Verification Commands

| Command | fast | full / ci | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| `forge fmt --check` | yes | yes | changed Solidity files |
| `npx solhint` | yes | yes | changed Solidity files |
| `forge build` | yes | yes | always |
| `forge test --match-path` | yes | no | changed/mapped targeted tests |
| `forge test -vvv` | no | yes | full / ci |
| `forge coverage` | no | yes | `change_class=prod-semantic` and `surface_sensitivity=sensitive` |
| `slither` | no | yes | same as coverage, only when changed production Solidity includes `src/**/*.sol` |
| `bash -n` | yes | yes | changed shell files |
| `node --check` | yes | yes | changed JavaScript files |
| `npm ci` | yes | yes | package manifest or lockfile changed |

## Test Mapping

When production Solidity changes, `gate:fast` resolves targeted tests from `policy.json -> test_mapping`. Each rule maps source paths to `change_tests` and `evidence_tests`.

Repository layout:

- `src/assets/{base,interfaces,omnichain}`
- `src/position/{interfaces}` plus `OutrunStakingPositionUpgradeable.sol`
- `src/yield/{interfaces,adapters/{aave,aster,ethena,etherfi,lido,lista,sky}}`
- `src/router/{interfaces}` plus `OutrunRouter.sol`
- `src/integrations/{aave,aster,etherfi,lido,lista,sky}`
- `test/{deploy,support,upgradeable}`
- `script/{deploy,deploy/deployment,harness,lib,ops}`
- `.harness/{runtime,schemas}` and `docs/`
